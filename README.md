Nengo model ideas
=================

Random ideas for models that could be made with Nengo if anyone has time.

Whenever I go to conferences, I usually stumble across a couple neat ideas that 
would make for nice, straightforward Nengo models.  However, I pretty much
always forget those ideas within a few days.  So, I'm making this repository.
The idea is to just post an Issue whenever you run across a paper that would
be interesting to model.  I'm generally thinking that these should be small
projects: models that might take someone familiar with Nengo an afternoon or a
few days to build.  These ideas might be suitable for student projects or
to give to people who are new to Nengo to get their feet wet.  But if you have
bigger projects, sure, post them as well.
